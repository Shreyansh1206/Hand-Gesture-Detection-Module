# Hand-Gesture-Detection-Module
The following repo contains two components:
- First is the static/dynamic detector, which is implemented in the `Static-or-not.py` file. It can be used by running this file.
- Second is the static gesture recognizer, which is a classifier model differentiating between a set of gestures. It can be used by running the `Static_Gesture_Detector` file.
